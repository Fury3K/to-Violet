                            Hello my love, How have you been? My (short) time off has given me enough time to think and show myself clarity in our situation. I don't want to say anything that might give 
                            you another reason to doubt me again. All I have left is to express myself through this site or message. I prayed for nothing but for us to grow
                            from this low in our relationship. If the time I have been absent is not enough for you to gather yourself and process everything that has happened 
                            I understand. Until then if you are ready, I would like to ask you only One thing. (Click the underlined text on top.) 
                        </p>
